INTRODUCTION                                    *Screenshot*

This plugin's main purpose is to take a Screenshot of the current window.
It utilizes the [scrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrot) binary,
so you'd have to make sure that `scrot` is installed.

COMMANDS                                        *Screenshot-commands*

Screenshot					      *:Screenshot*

        Takes a screenshot.

        The screenshot is placed in
        `$HOME/Pictures/Screenshot.nvim-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.png`.

        It also takes into account the existence of
        XDG user directories.

        That means, that if you have set a custom pictures like so:
        `XDG_PICTURES_DIR="$HOME/Pictures"`
        It'll write the Screenshots to this directory
        instead of the default `$HOME/Pictures`.

MAPPINGS                                        *Screenshot-mappings*

There are no mappings registered by the plugin.
You need to map it according to your preference.
