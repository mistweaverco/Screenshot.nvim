INTRODUCTION                                    *Screenshot*

This plugin's main purpose is to take a Screenshot of the current window.
It utilizes the [scrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrot) binary,
so you'd have to make sure that `scrot` is installed.

COMMANDS                                        *Screenshot-commands*

Screenshot					      *:Screenshot*

        Takes a screenshot.

        The screenshot is placed in
        `$HOME/Pictures/Screenshot.nvim-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.png`.

        It also takes into account the existence of
        XDG user directories.

        That means, that if you have set a custom pictures like so:
        `XDG_PICTURES_DIR="$HOME/Pictures"`
        It'll write the Screenshots to this directory
        instead of the default `$HOME/Pictures`.


        The `Screenshot` command can also be used with a range, e.g.:

        `:'<,'>Screenshot`

        This opens up a new buffer and sets the 'filetype'
        to the 'ft' where the selection
        came from and then it waits for 500ms and takes a Screenshot.

        Then it waits another 500ms and force closes the buffer (`:bd!`).

        IMPORTANT:
        Make sure 'hidden' or 'autowriteall' is set,
        otherwise this fails if there are unsaved changes.

MAPPINGS                                        *Screenshot-mappings*

There are no mappings registered by the plugin.
You need to map it according to your preference.
